SIG-13 : Deadlines notifications


There will be 2 kinds of notifications :
 - when a project manager defines or updates a deadline of a task/project
 - a reminder 

 > This kind of notification happens when the project manager defines or updates a deadline.
   This function can be called with “Deadlines management”. When a project deadline is defined, all users of the project will receive notification by email.
   When a task deadline is defined, only the user assigned to the task will receive the notification.
 > The project manager can create a reminder. That corresponds to a notification a week, for example, before the deadline.

In every case, the project manager will receive a confirmation email.
