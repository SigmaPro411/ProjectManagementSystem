  Meeting organizer 
 
 
As a meeting organizer I would like to first know the meeting agenda and attendees/participants of the meeting and the feasible time for the participants to attend the meeting. 
 
Once the time is finalized, I will organize the meeting invites with a brief description of the meeting agenda. 
I will organize the meeting decks and the key points to discuss in the meeting.  
I will segregate the time for each topic as per the deck. 
Ex: Assume the meeting is for 1 hour we will discuss/explain the client requirement (Product Manager) for first 15 minutes (Understanding the client requirement is extremely important). 
2. Followed by the Business Analyst to discuss further the budget, deadlines and expectations and follow-up timelines with the client for the next 15 minutes. 
3. Followed by the Product owner to discuss the understandings and suggestions and deadlines for the next 10 minutes. 
4. Followed by the team members to discuss more about the requirement and possible deadlines and explanation of products and planning and allocationg the work to the team memebers for next 10 minutes. 
5. Followed by Q and A session and conclusion by the Product manager and next possible meeting week.
