MEETING PARTICIPATION
	

As a team member

I want to be able to receive and view links for meetings shared and decide to join or not depending on my available schedule and be notified when a meeting is cancelled
so that i can participate in meetings.
	

1. The organizer should be able to create the link of the meeting so that it can be shared with other users	 
	
2. This join link must be visible among users
	
3. Once user click on Join the meeting Button, 
System should show confirmation popup with message 
" Do you want to attend the meeting?"
	A.YES
	B.NO

4. When user clicks on "YES" selected the link of the meeting should get join successfully and 
system should generate message as "You have successfully attended this meeting"

5. If User click on "NO", confirmation popup should be closed with no action perfomed.

6. If there is a change or cancellation in the meeting, 
an information message should be able to be sent by the organizer informing the users who will attend the meeting.
