SIG-22 : Deadlines management


First, a deadline has to be associated to a project.
That's why the function has to retrieve the project in the database.

Then, the function has to retrieve all tasks of the project.
The project manager can define a deadline for each of them.
All deadlines have to be in the future.

There can be a project deadline.
If a project deadline is define, there can't be a task deadline further than this date.
If the project manager try to define a project deadline earlier than a task deadline (that already exists),
the function return an error.

All deadlines can be modified by the project manager.
